# Interaction behaviour — 0.6.1

## Home

- Dock: Left/Right scrolls the apps without wrapping. Up enters the top-right controls, starting with Art Mode or the last selected control. Left/Right moves between Art Mode, All apps and Settings. Down or Back returns to the selected app. The clock is at the top left.
- List: Up/Down scrolls the apps without wrapping. Right enters the bottom-right controls, aligned with the clock above. Up/Down moves between Art Mode, All apps and Settings. Left or Back returns to the selected app. The list fades at both ends as it scrolls.
- OK opens the selected item. Focus alone never launches an app.
- Icons-only apps and controls reveal their names when focused. App presentation and control presentation are independent.
- Back from the app list or Dock opens a choice to stay or open Samsung Home.
- A panel keeps focus within its own controls. Back closes one panel at a time.
- Returning to the running launcher keeps the selected app or panel item. There is no auto-return timer. Held OK and Back keys act once until the key is released.

## Settings and appearance

Settings opens a grouped overview: Background, Layout, Typography, Focus, Apps on Home and Samsung. OK opens a group. Appearance groups use a two-pane screen with visible choices on the left and the committed Home preview on the right.

| Group | Choices |
| --- | --- |
| Background | Photo, Light, Dark; Wallpaper and Rotation when Photo is active |
| Layout | List or Dock; independent Text, Icons or Both choices for apps and Home controls |
| Typography | Manrope, Neue Montreal, Mori, Pangram Sans, Geist and Newsreader, when available |
| Focus | Type or Glass; Soft, Frost or Clear tint material |
| Apps on Home | Membership and arrangement editor |
| Samsung | Samsung Home and TV settings |

Up/Down moves between rows. Left/Right moves between choices in a horizontal row. Focus alone changes neither the preview nor saved preferences in these appearance groups. Wallpaper has its own temporary photo preview, described below. OK applies the focused value. A checkmark identifies the applied value; the filled plate identifies remote focus. Applying the current value does not write again.

Material applies to a photographic Dock, or Glass focus on a photographic List. Inactive material choices remain visible with an explanation and are skipped during navigation. Their stored value is retained. Wallpaper and rotation are also inactive on flat backgrounds.

A font or photo change applies only after its resources are ready and storage succeeds. A load or storage failure keeps the previous appearance and checkmark, with a Try again action. Back cancels a pending change, leaves the group and keeps completed changes. Late load callbacks cannot apply a cancelled choice. There is no Save button. Returning to a group restores its last choice focus; returning to Settings restores its category focus. Rotation is nested within Background, and Back returns to its Rotation row.

The selected font applies to Home app names, the clock and Home controls, including Newsreader. Settings, All apps, the Home editor and status text retain Manrope. The preview shows the committed Home appearance and its clock continues to update. Pangram faces are available in Nathan's private build when the local files are present; their binaries are not included in the public source. An unavailable optional face is omitted. If the baseline font is slow or missing, Home remains usable with a local fallback and can recover when the font loads.

## Streaming apps

The nine default apps keep their known native IDs. Other installed consumer apps can also be added to Home. Launching uses the public `tizen.application.launch` API with the app's native ID. Missing apps and denied launches produce a real error. No web player, placeholder success page or account credential is embedded.

## All apps

The panel reads `tizen.application.getAppsInfo` on entry and shows the filtered consumer apps alphabetically. Samsung's visibility flag alone also exposes system utilities, so EP packages, background services, ad players, account utilities, placeholders and duplicates are omitted. Known brands use bundled marks. Other apps use their local installed icon, with initials as a fallback.

The five-column grid scrolls with remote focus. OK launches an app; its On Home badge shows membership. Up from the first row reaches Apps on Home, which opens the editor. An API failure shows a retry and keeps saved Home choices. Browser previews report that installed-app discovery and launching require the TV.

## Apps on Home

Open the editor from Settings or All apps. On Home shows the current order on the left. Not on Home shows Recently removed first, followed by other installed apps on the right. Home holds one to nine apps.

- Reorder: OK on an app name picks it up. Up/Down moves it. OK places it and saves the order. Back puts an unplaced app back without saving that move.
- Remove: Right from an app name reaches Remove from Home. OK saves the removal and moves focus to the same app in Recently removed. The app stays installed.
- Add: OK on an app in Not on Home adds it and saves. A recently removed app returns to its previous position within the editing session; another app is added at the end. Focus follows the app to its Remove from Home control, so another OK can reverse the addition.
- Undo reverses a completed addition, removal or reorder from the current editing session. Done or Back closes the editor and keeps completed changes. Undo history ends when the editor closes.

Removing the last Home app or adding a tenth app is prevented. A failed storage write keeps the committed choices and order, with a retry message. Saved native app IDs and names survive a restart or a failed catalogue refresh.

## Art Mode and Samsung screens

Art Mode sends an application control to the installed `org.tizen.art-app`, with `mode=fullscreen` and `requester=mobile`. This aims to enter native Art Mode with its current artwork, without toggling power or changing the selected artwork.

This mode comes from [research on Samsung's Art app](https://github.com/TheFab21/ha-samsungtv-smart/blob/master/notes/QN55LS03FAFXZA/ART_MODE_DECOMPILED.md), on another Tizen 9 Frame model. It is an internal Samsung contract, not a documented public Art API. Its visible behaviour on this exact firmware must be confirmed on the TV.

Samsung Home explicitly launches the original `com.samsung.tv.csfs` app, independently of the new Home assignment. The earlier `com.samsung.tv.coba.newhome` component did not open Smart Hub visibly and is no longer the escape target. TV settings still uses `com.samsung.tv.coba.setting`. Exact on-device destinations are recorded in docs/tv-status.md; launch callbacks alone are not visual proof. There is no blind power-key fallback.

All calls have bounded response handling. A failure leaves CleanFrame usable. No simulated device success views remain. Browser validation cannot confirm the visible Samsung destination.

## Preferences and wallpaper

The launcher stores appearance, Home order, recently removed apps, the last launched Home app, wallpaper and rotation locally. List and Dock share these preferences. The existing `cleanframe.home.v1` key is retained, with a fallback read from `cleanframe.shore.v1`. Legacy List maps to Dark + List + Type; Glass Dock and Glass Grid map to Photo + Dock + Glass. App order, wallpaper, rotation and the last Home app are preserved.

The gallery contains 15 bundled wallpapers. Settings → Background → Wallpaper keeps the two-pane Settings frame. Up/Down browses a vertical thumbnail list without wrapping; the right-hand Home preview shows the candidate while the surrounding Settings backdrop stays on the applied photo. OK applies the focused photo and stays in Wallpaper. The tick marks the applied photo and preview status distinguishes unsaved browsing. Back restores the latest applied photo, cancels pending loading and returns to Background’s Wallpaper row. Photo and material assets change as one complete bundle; a failed load restores the applied preview and offers retry. Preview loading waits briefly for remote focus to settle. OK during loading queues application for that photo; another browse move or Back cancels it. Browsing never saves, and repeated OK on the applied photo does not write again.

Settings → Background → Rotation offers Fixed, Each time Home opens, Every 5 minutes, Every 15 minutes and Every hour. Each time Home opens advances once when the launcher loads; a return to the already-running launcher does not advance it. Timed rotation counts only visible Photo Home time in either List or Dock. Panels, flat backgrounds and time spent in other apps pause the cycle. Changing the photo or rotation mode starts a new interval.

Launcher wallpaper is separate from native Art Mode. Runtime photos, materials and available fonts are local assets; they do not require the Mac or a network download.

The native Home operation and startup configuration from 19 October remain separate from this app update. Home from Netflix was confirmed for that configuration; power-on after Netflix remains provisional. Streaming apps retain their own Back navigation. Netflix did not exit on repeated Back in the observed test, so there was no app-exit destination to verify. No global Back interception or key-filter hook was installed. See [TV status](tv-status.md) for device evidence; this behaviour specification is not an installation or visual-verification record for 0.6.0.

## Add-ons and Home Assistant

Settings › Add-ons appears only when this TV can run an add-on; today that means Home Assistant in the Android shell. Each add-on has one switch, off by default. While it is off it adds nothing to Home and does no work. It starts only after Home has painted.

With Home Assistant on and connected, Home gains a Smart home control after Settings, and the line under the clock gains the indoor temperature and humidity (from the first chosen room with a reading, in the weather's unit). The server address and long-lived access token are entered in the phone companion's Home Assistant card; the TV never shows or stores the token in its preferences. Settings › Add-ons › Home Assistant shows the connection, the rooms to show (Home Assistant's areas; every room shown by default, and devices hidden in Home Assistant stay hidden) and Disconnect, which asks first.

The Smart home control opens a panel. Rooms are headed rows of chips: the device name and its state. Rooms that fit on one line share a row, side by side on the chip grid, while they fit; a bigger room takes whole rows. Up and Down go to the nearest chip in the line above or below. A thin outline marks the room of the focused chip. Lights, switches and fans switch on OK, locks lock or unlock, and the chip changes at once while Home Assistant confirms within a second. Other devices only show their state, and OK says so. The line under the title counts the lights on and names what is unavailable (“3 lights on · Kitchen Strip unavailable”; more than two become a count).

Holding OK on a dimmable light opens its controls instead of switching it (a short OK still switches on release). OK on a thermostat opens its controls directly. The controls are a sheet of rows with one focus: a light has Power (OK switches), Brightness (Left and Right step 10%, turning the light on) and, when the light supports it, Colour (whites within its range, then colours; OK applies, the current one is ticked). A thermostat has its target temperature (Left and Right step by its own increment; a low/high range is shown but set in Home Assistant) and its modes (OK applies). Changes show at once and are sent once the remote rests, so a held Right sends one change. Back returns to the chip; a device that becomes unavailable closes its controls. Cameras sit in a column on the right: Right from the end of a row reaches them, Left returns to the nearest row, and Up from the first row or the first camera reaches Settings. Focusing a camera whose still is over a minute old takes one short snapshot. OK opens the full-screen live view, which keeps its single focus on a Smart home button; OK or Back closes it and ends the stream. Back closes the panel onto its control. Pressing Home, or leaving Shore, ends any camera stream.

## Clock and rendering

Both layouts show the TV's local time in 12-hour format, without AM/PM or seconds. It updates at the minute boundary and on return to the launcher. No date or clock panel is shown.

Photographic materials and blurred panel backgrounds are generated before packaging and stay aligned with the full-screen image. Photo colour and contrast metadata are also prepared offline. Navigation does not sample image pixels, run an optics engine or apply live backdrop blur. Flat backgrounds use matching light or dark panel colours. Focus feedback uses transforms and opacity; reduced motion removes animated scaling and movement while retaining opacity feedback.
